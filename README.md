# ARM.atm
This project acts like an ATM. It takes an input between $0 and $200. The program loops as to give the user multiple chances to make a transaction. If the user wants to not make a transaction and would like to stop the program, they enter 0. If the secret code -9 is entered, information about the transaction history is shared. This program has several different limits on the amount of money that can be taken, on top of the $200 maximum withdrawal per transaction. The ATM has a limited amount of $10's and $20's. Additonally, there is a limit on the number of transactions during the running of the program. There are further restrictions on the input, since it needs to make sure it has enough funds to allow the user to withdraw that sum of money. More detail can be found in the code, or you can contact me if you have any questions.
